        Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with
        litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens.[9] Domestic cats
        are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known
        as cat fancy. Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and
        neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has
        resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the
        extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.[1

      The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous
      mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae
      and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to
      distinguish it from the wild members of the family.[4] A cat can either be
      a house cat, a farm cat, or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and
      avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for
      companionship and their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are
      recognized by various cat registries.
